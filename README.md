# magnetic
Perl script visualizing the magnetic fields sourced from specified number of electric current loops.
The script builds the image of the magnetic fields in the plane orthogonal to the loops.
It is supposed that all loops have their centers in this same plane. 
Various parameters like the number and size of the loops can be set.
For immediate image output run the script in the browser as cgi.
