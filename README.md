# magnetic
Perl script visualizing the magnetic fields sourced from specified number of electric current loops.
The script builds the image of the magnetic fields in the plane orthogonal to the loops.
It is supposed that all loops have their centers in this same plane. 
Various parameters specify the position, orientation and the current of each loop.
For immediate image output run the script in the browser as cgi.
