# magnetic
Perl script visualizing of magnetic fields sourced from electric current loops.
The script builds the image of the magnetic fields in the plane orthogonal to the loops.
It is supposed that all loops have their centers in this same plane.
Various parameters like the number and size of the loops can be set.
